# stock-analyzer-with-gui

A stock analyzer program that allows the 10/20/50 weekly moving average to be visualized against the daily price of a ticker using tkinter and matplotlob. The text file containing the base tickers (filtered_list.txt) are pre-filtered to include only sticks with 10M or less outstanding shares. The program filters out stocks <$3 and >$15 during program load.
